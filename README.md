### Usage

Using this website, you can view information about me, my portfolio and my contact information.

 Take the time to explain the work you did on a project, as well as any special circumstances or problems you worked through. That will give potential employers or clients a better idea of your work style and thought process, so they can imagine how they might also work with you.
 
 Focus on what work you want/like to do. And who you want to work with.
 
 To show what you can do to make the client’s/employer’s life easier.
