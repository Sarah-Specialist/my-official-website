                <p>I decided to give it a shot, and never looked back!</p>
                <p>Growing up, I’ve always had a knack for Science and pursued my passion for the Healthcare industry. As part of the medical ICU team, I’ve worked in high-pressure work environment and contributed as a front-line healthcare worker during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will always retain a strong interest toward Healthcare, and I cannot wait to merge those experiences with new skills that I am learning everyday.</p>
                <p>I’ve had an interest in coding for a long time, and I used to spend my free time attending courses and reading up. I am currently enrolled in the Software Developer Immersive course at Nanyang Technological University. We are currently learning React Native! I'm graduating in May 2022 and looking for a software developer role!</p><br />
